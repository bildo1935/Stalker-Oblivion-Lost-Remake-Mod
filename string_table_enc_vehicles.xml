1. It is not recommended to save the game when in car. Leave the car at first.
\n \n2. After level changing when in car (or after loading when in car) do not leave it at once, you have to drive off several meters. Or you will get stuck at the exit.
\n \n3. If after level changing when in car (or after loading when in car) the hands are not precisely located on a driving wheel, legs are visible instead of hands or the external camera is buggy, so leave the car, make the save-load (F6-F7) and get back into the car.
\n \n4. If the car got stuck without the obvious reasons (the motor works, but does not go), leave the car, save, exit to windows and start the game again.
\n \n5. If the car slides strangely, reload the game.
\n \n6. The position of the bought cars is displayed on the map only till the first loading of the saved game.
