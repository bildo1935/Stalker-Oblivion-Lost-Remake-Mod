	<string id="enc_social_military_army">
		<text>Regular army soldiers. They guard all roads into the Zone, patrol its perimeter, kill mutants and hunt down looters. \nSpetsnaz - elite army troops, usually dispatched to the Zone to conduct rescue operations and other special missions.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_social_military_milstalkers">
		<text>Soldiers who underwent special training following their service in the Zone or stalkers who voluntarily signed a contract with the Army. Usually equipped with various support gear and well-armed. Used mainly to study the causes and effects of the catastrophe and to map out the Zone. They can work on their own or in small detachments of up to five people. Military stalkers do not allow normal stalkers to approach and open fire on sight.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_social_scientists_mobile-groups">
		<text>Erased</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_social_scientists_mobile-labs">
		<text>A mobile lab resembles a small, armored bunker with tiny windows of tainted glass. The lab is capable of withstanding a lot of damage and with its reliable life-support systems it can work autonomously for several months. The bunker is delivered into the Zone by a transport helicopter. The lab staff never allow visitors past the external air-lock chamber, so no stalker has ever been inside one.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_social_stalker-clans_bandits">
		<text>Members of the criminal underworld who came to the Zone for different reasons: to make money by selling artifacts, hide from the law or trade in weapons. The Zone is full of bandits, ranging from common thugs to serious criminals, most of whom are members of one gang or another. Although the Zone gangs frequently fight among themselves, the criminal element still poses a serious problem for normal stalkers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_social_stalker-clans_duty">
		<text>These stalkers consider it their duty to protect the world from mutants. They routinely destroy mutant lairs. They consider themselves Chernobyl witchers and vampire hunters.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_social_stalker-clans_freedom">
		<text>Anarchists and freedom fighters outside of anyone's control. They fight against the army and the government, and their goal is the Zone as a natural reserve. They believe in sharing all information about the Zone with the rest of the world. At war with the Monolith faction. They routinely eliminate military stalker expeditions.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_social_stalker-clans_killers">
		<text>The most clandestine and secretive faction in the Zone; some don't even believe in its existence. There are those who regularly use the killers' services as they are true pros, able to quickly deal with any stalker and even annihilate a small group of opponents. Their services do not come cheap - the Mercs demand a king's ransom for their services in money or artifacts. The location of their base remains a secret, suggesting that it is deep inside the Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_social_stalker-clans_loners">
		<text>Stalkers exploring the Zone on their own. Most stalkers work this way since being a member of a group takes precious time, and part of the loot. Then there are some who simply prefer solitude and independence.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_social_stalker-clans_monolith">
		<text>A group of stalkers that believes that an ethereal evolutionary crystal known as the Monolith lies in the center of the Zone. At war with factions Duty and Freedom.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="enc_social_stalker-clans_zomstalkers">
		<text>Poor souls subjected to prolonged exposure in Yantar and a few other heavily radiated sectors. Careless stalkers gone mad and turned into walking corpses. Many such corpses wander the Zone, some wander as far as the perimeter. They are beyond help because the destructive process is irreversible. Zombified stalkers are still able to use their weapons, but they are quite dumb and can be heard mumbling meaningless, fragmented sentences to themselves. They gradually lose all their skills and turn into zombies. They are usually very aggressive and can present a serious threat in large numbers.</text>
