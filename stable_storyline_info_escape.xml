		<text>Tolik's diary:\nTrader sent us to get an artifact in the Dark Valley. He says it's valuable. So we agreed to it... Got there and shot everybody we could. We found the artifact where the trader told us it'd be. Then we went back... On the way back, my partner suddenly had some kind of seizure. Twisted around like crazy... Had to wait it out for a few hours.\nWe arrived in the Cordon in the morning. We walked around the vehicle station, since there's nothing to do there right now... We almost made it to the village - and then shit hit the fan. We ran into the military. God damn it! They demanded all the stuff we found, including the Compass... Rare artifact, probably one of a kind... No idea what happened to it, it's probably already been sold in the Great Land. Ugh... We're walking the road - we can already see the village...\nReally bad day, really bad...</text>

	<string id="esc_blockpost_military_raport_descr">
		<text>This is how things went... We went around the perimiter, not far from the outpost. Saw a couple of stalkers who were hanging around the train car by the road. We decided to shake 'em up, fill out an "accident report," things in the Zone and all that. So, naturally, предложили другой выход из ситуации... Basically, they had a circle-shaped artifact that they seem to call the "Compass"... Put simply, after we "bargained" with them, a helicopter flew by us, seemingly a military bird, but definitely not one of ours. And, basically, it finished off those stalkers by the train car. Probably. Though I did hear gunshots a couple of times, seemingly from a PM... So, we didn't hang around there and just ran. But we didn't bring the artifact to the outpost. We hid it in a stash... Took a long time to carry it, but it was worth it. Basically, the "anomalous formation" will be hidden north of the vehicle station, around the blocked-up railway tunnel, in the rocks. Think I hid it well...\nBasically, this ain't a good report at all - I wrote a lot of "personal" stuff. But you should read it when you get the time. And don't give the computer password to anybody.\nL. Plyusch.</text>
