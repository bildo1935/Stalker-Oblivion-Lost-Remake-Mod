<text>How are you, stalker? Are you ok? What happened?</text>
</string>
<string id="agr_propusk_1">
<text>A bloodsucker, damn it... Didn’t see it... while I was hunting... flesh... It crept up from behind... Agh, damn it... There’s a hidden stalker stash somewhere around the factory. Strelok. Have you heard that name? I’ve heard he was at the center, so I decided to check this place out.</text>

<text>Enough yapping. Save your energy.</text>

<string id="agr_propusk_3">
<text>Agh, damn, the mutants... Where did they come from? I barely escaped from them. They hurt me real bad... You probably don’t know about what happened here... It was half a year ago. Children from the closest villages all went to the Zone one morning. The authorities kept quiet about it. One guy worked on that... Everyone called him Journalist... I somehow met him... He said that the children went deep into the Zone. And he either hired a pro - a “stalker of God” by the name of Strelok, or he earned that title with time... Basically, he’s somehow connected to this Strelok... And Strelok also went deep into the Zone. But first, Journalist went looking for something in the MedPribor Research Institute... Documents...</text>

 <text>Hi. One of your guys sent me.</text> 
 </string> 
 <string id="joonnar_1"> 
 <text>Listen, things aren’t exactly sunshine and rainbows around here... Basically, we received information on a very valuable artifact with specific properties. It’s here in the MedPribor. It should’ve been delivered to scientists, but apparently, something went wrong. You know... I'm not interested in getting the artifact to Yantar. I don’t think the Professor will be able to do anything with it. The only thing that he’s good at is sending expendable stalkers on impossible missions...</text>

The best way of getting in is during the night 'cause the base is well-guarded during the day - they got checkpoints everywhere and anyway, I heard a deserter-soldier from that base is hiding in the marshes.

		<text>The exit from the railway tunnel is nearby. It's fairly safe in the dead end. At least nobody has been eaten while sleeping...yet.  Also, to the Northwest of the factory you'll find a marsh with a wagon in it.  But be careful, there's a shitload of radiation around it, so it's best to approach it from the western side. Oh, and one more thing: a soldier has been spotted there. He's likely to be from the military base at the Institute. The poor bastard is probably crazy - he's been there for a couple of days and I doubt he'll survive much longer on his own.</text>

	<string id="agr_stalker_talk_level_0">
		<text>Tell me about this place.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_stalker_talk_level_1">
		<text>This is the area around the Agroprom Research Institute. The Institute itself is to the Southwest. The factory, which served as the Institute's technical production facility, is to the North. The buildings have been abandoned for a long time and there's nothing to be found there, but the army has been searching there very actively recently.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_stalker_talk_level_2">
		<text>Tell me more about the Institute.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_stalker_talk_level_21">
		<text>There are loads of legends about the Institute. Before the accident in 1986 the only thing here was the Institute of Crop Selection and Genetics. The area where the factory is now was used for experimental crop fields. After the accident, they closed the Institute and burned the fields. Then they remembered about it, they whitewashes the building, put up a fence around it and built some barracks. I don't know what they did at the Institute but they didn't have any shortage of funding, that's for sure.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_stalker_talk_level_3">
		<text>Tell me more about the factory.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_stalker_talk_level_31">
		<text>The factory was built at the end of the 80s. They said it was going to be used to build and test machines that could treat soil affected by radiation. As far as I know, nobody ever saw a single machine come out of that plant. It's totally empty now, which makes it a favorite spot for stalkers. I hear the place is pretty safe as long as you avoid the dark corners.</text>

	<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks_141">
		<text>What are you going to do now?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks_20">
		<text>I am from the recon unit. They sent us into the catacombs to see what's going on below the base. It's hell down there, I'm telling you. I was the only one to get out of there... everyone else is probably dead by now. I don't want to go back to the base - those bastards are always using us to plug up all the holes in this damn Zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks_30">
		<text>Underground tunnels. They go from the Institute to the area around it - I'll show you the entrances. I don't have maps of the catacombs themselves.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks_40">
		<text>At the HQ. It's on the third floor of the Institute. That's where they keep those damn papers. But it's a mission getting there. By day, the area is teaming with patrols but not as much at night. I'll tell you this for free: if you wanna get inside you'll have to go through the catacombs - you stand no chance at the gate.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="agr_swamp_ratcatcher_talks_50">
		<text>Hmm. I don't know. I am a deserter according to the military code and I need to get out of the Zone somehow. When we first got here there was a Zaporozhets in the garage that was almost working. I brought it back to life in half an hour but that damn captain took it for himself claiming he should have it according to the code. He drove it along this road and dumped it in the rain by the gate. If only I could get that car - making a run for it is much safer on wheels!</text>

        <text>Deal, then. Just be careful. Don’t get in the way of any stray bullets. He he. I like people with a sense of humor. Have a thousand back. Buy yourself some higher quality pants. Ha ha.</text>

        <text>You’re a real funny guy. Other people go out on strolls in the Canary Islands while we work here. We “worked” with the military. You ask too many questions and we might “work” with you too.</text>

        <text>Ha ha. I see you’re a little guy with a sense of humor. I like that. It’s rare seeing your type in the Zone. Everyone here’s too moody. No, to enjoy every day you live through, you have to constantly fear death.</text>
