To head of project “Psy-Barrier” Prof. V.M. Chubko. From head of laboratory X16, Candidate of Technical Sciences P.S. Prikhodko
“Report on tests on unit ZX-16 in extreme conditions.”
The tests were done twice, both in a forced barrier overheat scenario. The ZX-16 unit was turned on in regular operational mode: psy-field - "External protection". The trials revealed the appearance of uncontrolled psy-emitter waves and an induction field after 5-6 minutes of work. The strenght of the psy-field was 50-60 percent higher than usual. That's a whooping 170-190 psiA in absolute value. The results do not line up with Kasayev's theory about inductioned psy-fields, because during the overheating process the value lowered. Some workers assume that the rise of temperature of the unit because of overheating leads to the intensification of the neuro activity of the YA-1M pseudobrain, after which the brain becomes some sort of a retranslator of the psy-emitter, and not only just a source of psy-waves. In order to confirm this we need to do additional experiments, for which we lack funding. There are also employees who openly admit that something is wrong with their heads and they don't understand anything. That really is a problem: we sadly will have to say goodbye to some of our employees. Biomaterials that were subject to psy-field testing have sadly become unusuable as of late because of irreversible changes to the brain and the nervous system. Results of tomography and encephalography are attached to certain report cards. Looking over the unplanned and unpredicted results of the experiment with unit ZX-16, it is safe to say that they are very interesting because they show that using the psy-emitter along with the YA-1M pseudobrain can ultimately give more certain results of the psy-barrier project when compared to our rivals at lab X-19.
12.12.2007 P.S Prikhodko.
P.S.: In order to continue the experiments, we need a new batch of biomaterials. We need 10 animal units and 10 human units from grouping 1296-bis. In addition, I request, if possible, some additional security forces, because keeping test subjects at bay is becoming a bit problematic. After the last experiment, a few of the subjects managed to escape. Some were neutralized during the chase. The rest went into a highly irradiated area that we couldn't enter, so we had to end the chase there.

To head of laboratory X16, P.S. Prikhodko
Mr. Stepanovich, from the way I see it, after the experiments not only some of your employees lost their minds, but you did too. Experimenter, fucking hell! Who gave you the permission to do these tests?! Didn't your grandfather work at the 4th block of the CNPP in 1986 by accident? And although in '86 the personnel came under the influence of the "Russian Woodpecker" (at least in this case there is at least a reason for that dumb experiment), I can't find any excuse for your actions! In the instructions it is clearly written: "under any circumstances do NOT crank up the power of the psy-radiation above 120 psiA." Did you forget about this? God damnit! As a result you've lost control of the test subjects and most importantly you've let them escape. Do you know how hard it is for me to obtain new bio material samples? Do you even begin to realise what would happen if the public discovered what we were doing down here? I hope you do. That's why I ask you to not do these kinds of experiments in the future without my permission. I understand the desire of a young scientist to be better than his rivals, but you can't lose your head! And about rivals... Yesterday X-19 managed to keep their psy-emitters stable while running them with only TWO breaks to cool them off in 24h - from 0830 to 0945 and from 2012 to 2100. That's why, when compared to your method (5 minutes of work - 3 minutes of cooling), X-19 turns out better. The psy-barrier should be able to work stably, without errors and without timed breaks. I do not want to anger you, I also think that your "psy-brain - psi emitter" method is more modern, progressive, intelligent and has a better future ahead of itself. There is only one BUT. The psy-barrier is needed right away, so for now we will probably use X-19's variant of the psi machine, although it does somewhat work like a bit like a hammer - bam, and there is no brains in the local area. But, as they say, "no fuss, no muss." It is cheap and effective (I am joking, of course). Make sure to tell wish the entire staff a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year from me.  
Prof. V.M. Chubko 20.12.2007
P.S. When it comes to the new batch of test subjects, I will meet with my supplier soon.</text>

		<text>Orders on laboratory X16.
In light of the catastrophic processes that began on April 12 this year in the center of the Zone of Alienation around the Chernobyl NPP, I hereby issue these orders: 1.	the laboratory staff shall make copies of laboratory work reports and gather 4 sets of documentation. Destroy the original documents marked as "secret." 2.	the security shall eliminate all biomaterials. 3.	a temporary shutdown of the laboratory shall be carried out. 4.	the experimental program "Cover of Darkness" shall be prepared for loading into the "YA-1M" pseudo-brain and also activate all external tracking sensors. 5.	wind generators and backup power sources shall be activated. The laboratory should be switched to power saving mode. 6.	all staff shall make their way to the head labroatory in region Z17-45 in groups of 3 persons. Each group will carry one set of documentation. Each group shall be accompanied by one guard. All personnel will wear hazmat suits. 7.	Good luck to everyone.

		<text>Suicide note
I, Pavel Stepanovich Prikhodko, head of laboratory X16, born in 1976, being of sound mind, voluntarily leave life today on April 26, 2008. And now I just want to explain the reasons. I hope someone finds this note and passes it on to my family and colleagues, to whom I remained faithful to the end. Two weeks ago, I wrote an order regarding laboratory X16's shutdown. After the events on April 12, thge laboratory was no longer able to function normally. Communication with the central HQ was lost. After making copies of documents on the laboratory work results, I sent four of my employess into the main laboratory. I trust that one of them will come, and the invaluable results of our work will not be in vain. And they will benefit our GREAT cause. Furthermore, left alone, I've loaded the program "Cover of Darkness," developed by us, into our brainchild, the "YA-1M" pseudo-brain, which was supposed to make our ZX-16 psy-protection kit render the entire facility invisible to any creature within 200 metres in addition to deterring them from getting too close. So, I shall be brief: I do not know why, but this program did not work. When I tried to leave the psy-protected room with the "brain," I received a shattering psy-order to defend the object and kill all uninvited guests. When I woke up, I found myself in the same spot again. I don't remember how I returned. For the past two weeks, which I've spent in this room - I have asked myself one question a thousand times: "How could I mess up so bad that I accidentaly entered the wrong program, the one that was still in development?". The answer frightens me: perhaps the most fantastical hypothesis from my colleagues about the possibility of the YA-1M developing self-learning was true. If so, then that monster is probably slyly grinning next to me right now. I tried to break its corpus, but to no avail. My PM can do nothing against this bulletproof glass, and all automatic weapons were taken by the guards. Disabling the complex now can only be done using the backup control panel. I have gotten myself straight into a trap. Water and food ran out a week ago. If I leave the room, the psy-emissions will destroy me as a person, and my last living days will be spent as a vegetable. I don't want to end up like that. Therefore, I have left the last bullet in my pistol for myself.
Good luck to everyone... Don't think ill of me. Pavel.

Despite its small size, it provides excellent protection against more intensive radiation and harmful anomalous effects from higher-end artifacts. It's made out of a special heavy-duty plastic that's coated on the outside with a layer of a protective metal alloy developed by scientists from the Yantar mobile lab. The manufacturing process for this specific container is kept secret. This container is in great demand among professional artifact collectors.</text>
