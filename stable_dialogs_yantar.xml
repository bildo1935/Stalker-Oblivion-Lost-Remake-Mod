	    <text>Professor, can you tell me something about the mutants of the Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_saharov_monsters_1">
	    <text>Which species do you want to know about? Also, I don't know of every species, so yeah.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_saharov_monsters_11">
	    <text>Tell me about the controllers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_saharov_monsters_12">
	    <text>Tell me about the zombies.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_saharov_monsters_13">
	    <text>Tell me about the burers. I hate burers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_saharov_monsters_14">
	    <text>Tell me about the pseudogiants.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_saharov_monsters_15">
	    <text>Tell me about the pseudodogs, and regular dogs.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_saharov_monsters_111">
	    <text>There are many theories about the origin of these mutants. The most popular theory is that they are the result of a failed experiment on the human brain. They're  very dangerous, they can take control of almost anyone if they so much as look at them. Meeting a controller in an open space is an almost certain death.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_saharov_monsters_121">
	    <text>There are many of them, especially here, at Yantar. They're walking shells of humans who underwent prolonged exposure to psi radiation. They're most dangerous in the first stage of degradation because they can carry and use weapons. In later stages they're just walking corpses.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_saharov_monsters_131">
	    <text>Dwarves, we don't know anything about their upbringing, but it probably has something to do with experiments on controllers. They posses kinetic powers, which means that they can move objects from a distance without even touching them. Very dangerous creatures, they mostly inhabit underground areas due to their eyes hating light.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_saharov_monsters_141">
	    <text>One of the most disgusting creatures of the Zone. They strike fear into even the most experienced of stalkers by their sheer size, their skin is extremely hard to break through even with rifle bullets. Dumb, giant and extremely aggressive.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_saharov_monsters_151">
	    <text>During the Second Explosion, many animals, including dogs, were affected by extreme amounts of energy released by the blowouts. They mutated afterwards. Pseudodogs are usually leaders of packs of blind dogs. An encounter with a big group can be tragic. It is important to mention that some pseudodogs have also obtained psionic powers through some unknown means.</text>

   <string id="o2_bar_1">
     <text>Great. Was anyone there?</text>

   <string id="o2_bar_2">
     <text>Yeah, there was one stalker. By the way, can you tell me about that village?</text>
  </string>
   <string id="o2_bar_3">
     <text>Workers of this very facility lived there, along with their families. I've heard that they all perished in the blink of an eye.</text>

   <string id="o2_bar_4">
    <text>Yeah, I've heard that, too. Listen, do you know anything about the Journalist?</text>
  </string>
   <string id="o2_bar_5">
    <text>There goes a stalker by that name. He went missing a couple months ago looking for information about the Zone.</text>
  </string>
   <string id="o2_bar_6">
    <text>OK.</text>
   </string>
  <string id="o2_bar_7">
    <text>Once again, thanks for your help, Messer.</text>
  </string> 

   <string id="o_bar_0">
     <text>What is the job?</text>
  </string>
   <string id="o_bar_1">
     <text>You need to drive a truck with a container to the village.</text>
  </string>
   <string id="o_bar_2">
     <text>What truck?</text>
  </string>
   <string id="o_bar_3">
     <text>The one at the base, obviously! It's waiting outside. Here, take the keys. Leave the truck and the container there.</text>
  </string>
   <string id="o_bar_4">
    <text>Will someone be waiting for me there?</text>
  </string>
   <string id="o_bar_5">
     <text>Yes, a stalker will be waiting for you there. We work closely with the usual stalkers, but this guy is snob. If does not want to communicate, you can contact him on PDA. Though it is optional, the main objective - to deliver freight into place.</text>
  </string>
   <string id="o_bar_6">
    <text>Understood.</text>
   </string>
  <string id="o_bar_7">
    <text>Just don't hit the gas too hard, Messer.</text>
  </string> 

   <string id="sahs_bar_0">
     <text>All the measurements are done, Professor.</text>
  </string>
   <string id="sahs_bar_1">
     <text>Yes, I've already received the results.</text>
  </string>
   <string id="sahs_bar_2">
     <text>What do we do now?</text>
  </string>
   <string id="sahs_bar_3">
     <text>The entire thing is becoming clearer. There really is an underground complex beneath the lake, and something in that lab emits psi radiation. Based on the results, it appears that it is possible to reach that thing and turn it off. The thing is that all the entrances to the complex are blocked. That's why I've creating this sort of psi-blocking device which will reduce the amount of radiation you receive and will allow you to get into the lab.</text>
  </string>
   <string id="sahs_bar_4">
    <text>So you want me to turn that thing off?</text>
  </string>
   <string id="sahs_bar_5">
    <text>Exactly. Here's the psi-blocker. The entrance to the lab is located in the giant hangar at the complex. I don't have the exact coordinates of the control room, so you will have to find it yourself.</text>
  </string>
   <string id="sahs_bar_6">
    <text>I'll do my best, doc.</text>
   </string>
  <string id="sahs_bar_7">
    <text>Great. You're our best hope, Messer.</text>
  </string> 


   <string id="sah_bar_0">
     <text>Greetings Professor, Barkeep sent me here. He said that you can help me get to the center of the Zone.</text>
  </string>
   <string id="sah_bar_1">
     <text>Good day, Messer. Yes, Barkeep and I talked about that. Theoretically, you can get to the center, but as we all know the road is blocked by psi radiation emitted by some unknown device.</text>
  </string>
   <string id="sah_bar_2">
     <text>Is there anything I can do to help?</text>
  </string>
   <string id="sah_bar_3">
     <text>We are located in one of the few science labs in the Zone, our goal is to study and better understand the Zone. There is an unknown psi-emitter located underground in this area. It's construction and mechanisms are very similar to the ones up north. If we could better know how it works, then we could develop psi-blockers allowing stalkers to get to the center of the Zone. Some time ago we started work on the blockers, many scientists in different regions of the Zone studied psionics and also worked on the blockers. Sadly, most of these men went missing, but their work should still be scattered around the Zone. From what I know they managed to make 2 psi-blocker prototypes. You need to bring them to me. The first one is in the lab under the Dark Valley. You'll find it in a locked room. The code to the locked door is 4678. The 2nd prototype is located in one of the apartments in the Shining Path, up north. You can get some more info from the Freedom leader, he and our colleagues worked together. We also need some sort of a gravitational contraption which has the ability of picking up and throwing things based on kinetic force. We don't have many information on that subject yet. You should search for that device at the Dark Valley lab, in the underground complex. The dwarves there have created some sort of sanctuary, and perhaps they know where you can find such a contraption.</text>
  </string>
   <string id="sah_bar_4">
    <text>OK, I'll get the prototypes.</text>
  </string>
   <string id="sah_bar_5">
    <text>I'm glad to hear that, Messer. Now be careful around here, the lake is filled with hotspots of radiation. You'll reach the Shining Path by a way behind one of the antennas to the north. Also, speak to the leader of Clear Sky, he should have some extra work for you.</text>
  </string>
   <string id="sah_bar_6">
    <text>I'll talk to him.</text>
   </string>
  <string id="sah_bar_7">
    <text>We'll decide what to do next later.</text>
  </string>  


   <string id="sahh_bar_0">
     <text>Good day Professor, I brought what you asked for.</text>
  </string>
   <string id="sahh_bar_1">
     <text>Greetings, Messer. Great, give them to me and see what we can do with them.</text>
  </string>
   <string id="sahh_bar_2">
     <text>Well, what do you say?</text>
  </string>
   <string id="sahh_bar_3">
     <text>Interesting, interesting. Lots of useful stuff here. Sadly, the data here is encrypted. On top of that, you will need to measure the local psi-field.</text>
  </string>
   <string id="sahh_bar_4">
    <text>Psi-field measurement? But I don't know how to make good measurements, especially of some psi-fields!</text>
  </string>
   <string id="sahh_bar_5">
    <text>Yeah that's what I thought, that's why I ordered one of our men to help you do that. You'll need to protect him while he's doing the measurements. In front of our base is a car park, you'll meet him there. He should come from the direction of the grounded ark.</text>
  </string>
   <string id="sahh_bar_6">
    <text>Alright, I'll do that right away.</text>
   </string>
  <string id="sahh_bar_7">
    <text>A lot of mutant activity was reported around there lately, so keep extra cautious.</text>
  </string>  


<string id="zam_talk_0">
		<text>Are you the guy who's supposed to measure the fields?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zam_talk_1">
		<text>Yes, that is me. The plan goes like this - we'll go towards the tower located near the village, then we'll go to the left side of the car park.</text>
 
	</string>
	<string id="zam_talk_2">
		<text>Alright.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="zam_talk_3">
		<text>Oh and by the way, stalkers arrived in that BTR. I guess the Professor managed to get some extra protection after all. Anyways, let's go.</text>
	</string>








<string id="sah_talk_0">
		<text>Tell me, what kind of emissions happen around here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sah_talk_1">
		<text>We don't know their nature, we only know that they come from under the ground.</text>
 
	</string>
	<string id="sah_talk_2">
		<text>Interesting.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sah_talk_3">
		<text>We have a theory that those emissions are caused by the psi-emitter located under the complex.</text>

	</string>
	<string id="yantar_general_ucheniy_talk_start_1011">
		<text>Yes, you just did to me and need. It is necessary to decipher some very important documents. I was advised to you.</text>

		<text>And how can I help?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yantar_general_ucheniy_talk_start_1012">
		<text>We need information from Lab X16. Or, rather, information about the mechanism inside it that generates emissions which directly affects people's consciousness. I'm afraid I have to disappoint you: the place is impossible to penetrate without special psi-armor. The outcome is known in advance - even if you could evade the swarms of zombies that infest the laboratory entrance, you run the risk of becoming one of them. This is all very serious. However, we've designed a screening device to help shield the emission, but to fine-tune it we have to obtain additional measurements. If you help us with this task, we could probably provide you with a protective helm prototype.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yantar_general_ucheniy_talk_start_1013">
		<text>I need to make measurements, and then in the laboratory to find information about this device. So?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yantar_general_ucheniy_talk_start_1014">
		<text>Yes, that's right. We really need these data. Perhaps because of them can be eliminated or at least weaken the radiation. If you together with our staff will make all necessary measurements, I am prepared to work a prototype of the protective device and will give it to you. It is likely, will help to penetrate the laboratory.</text>

Try to find his body: he had accurate information about the laboratory - where it is and how to get in. He might have also known how to turn off the emissions.

		<text>OK, but don't say I didn't warn you. Vasiliev worked on the laboratory problem. About a week ago, he and stalker by the name of Ghost attempted to get inside the laboratory. After several hours we felt a shake and emissions stopped; after another hour, we got a signal from Vasiliev, it was coming from the swamp but then vanished. By the looks of things, Vasiliev is gone. Try to find his body: he had accurate information about the laboratory - where it is and how to get in. He might have also known how to turn off the emissions.

		<text>Now your path to the laboratory is clear... except that if the source of the emission isn't destroyed and doesn't lose its power, you may not have enough time to get back.

		<text>Vasiliev was working on the lab issue. About a week ago he and a stalker called Ghost tried to get inside.

Try to find his corpse. He had the exact information on the lab and the way to get into it. There may even be info on deactivating that source of the emission.
